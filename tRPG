## 1. Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive plan for developing a text-based RPG (tRPG). The design emphasizes a modular, data-driven, and event-based approach, focusing on creating a minimal, immersive, and smooth experience for the player. All game data (encounters, quests, items, and world structure) is managed externally, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1. System Architecture
- **Core Engine:**  
  - **Game Loop:** Manages overall game progression, state management, and player turns.  
  - **Input Handler:** Processes text-based commands from the player and routes them to the appropriate systems.
  
- **Data Management Module:**  
  - **Data Loader:** Imports game configuration (world data, encounters, quests, items) from external files (e.g., JSON).  
  - **Data Serializer:** Saves and restores game state to support persistence.

- **Gameplay Modules:**  
  - **World & Exploration Module:** Handles the map, location transitions, and location-based events.  
  - **Combat Module:** Implements turn-based combat mechanics, damage calculations, and basic enemy AI.  
  - **Inventory & Items Module:** Manages player items, equipment, and consumables.  
  - **Quest & Narrative Module:** Drives the story, branching narratives, and quest progression.
  
- **Optional Modules:**  
  - **Procedural Generation Module:** Dynamically generates encounters, loot, and events based on player progress and randomness.  
  - **AI & Behavior Module:** Enhances enemy and NPC behavior through simple state machines or behavior trees.

|  (JSON Files)     |        | (World, Combat, etc.)|
+-------------------+        +----------------------+
```

### 2.3. Scalability Considerations
- **Data-Driven Approach:** New encounters, quests, and items are added via external files, minimizing code changes.  
- **Modularity:** Each module is developed independently, allowing for easier testing, maintenance, and future enhancements.  
- **Event-Driven Mechanism:** Supports dynamic encounters and adaptive gameplay based on player actions.

## 3. Design

### 3.1. Game Concept
The game is a text-driven adventure where players explore a rich world, engage in turn-based combat, manage their inventory, and navigate branching storylines influenced by their decisions.

### 3.2. Gameplay Mechanics

#### Exploration & Navigation
- **World Structure:** The game world is represented as interconnected locations (towns, dungeons, forests) stored in a structured data file.
- **Navigation:** Players explore the world using text commands (e.g., "go north," "enter dungeon").

#### Combat System
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Combat is structured in turns, with both the player and enemy taking actions sequentially.
- **Encounter Triggering:** Encounters are initiated by player movement or specific narrative events, with enemy data loaded from external files.
- **Damage Calculation:** Damage is determined using predefined random ranges (e.g., [5, 15]) set in the data files.

#### Inventory Management
- **Item Types:** Encompasses weapons, consumables (like potions), and quest-specific items.
- **Mechanics:** Players can pick up, use, equip, or discard items, with all data maintained dynamically.
- **Data Storage:** Inventory details are stored externally and updated in real time during gameplay.

#### Quests & Narrative
- **Quest System:** Quests, including objectives, triggers, and rewards, are defined in separate data files.
- **Branching Storylines:** Player choices affect the narrative outcome, creating multiple paths and endings.
- **Event Triggers:** Story events are activated by location changes, combat outcomes, or specific player actions.

#### Procedural Generation (Optional)
- **Dynamic Encounters:** Based on factors such as player level, location, and RNG, encounters and loot are generated dynamically to maintain variety.
- **Scalability:** This system adjusts enemy strength and rewards relative to player progress.

### 3.3. Class Structure (Conceptual)
- **GameEngine:** Orchestrates the game loop, state management, and integration of all modules.
- **Player:** Manages attributes like health, stats, and inventory.
- **Entity:** A base class for all characters in the game (player and enemies).
- **CombatManager:** Oversees combat mechanics, turn sequencing, and damage calculation.
- **WorldManager:** Handles the game world’s map, locations, and exploration logic.
- **DataManager:** Loads external game data and manages state persistence.
- **QuestManager:** Manages quest progression and branching narrative logic.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Functional Requirements
- **Gameplay:**  
  - Turn-based combat with responsive enemy encounters.  
  - Text-based navigation and exploration.
  - Inventory management with dynamic item handling.
  - Quest system that adapts to player decisions.
- **Data Management:**  
  - Loading and updating game data from external files.  
  - Saving and restoring game progress.
- **User Interface:**  
  - Command-line interface with clear, context-sensitive prompts and feedback.

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Modularity:** Components must be loosely coupled for independent development and testing.
- **Scalability:** Easy expansion of game content via external data files.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and adhere to best practices.
- **Performance:** Fast response times with low resource usage.
- **Usability:** An intuitive experience with clear commands, descriptive prompts, and immediate feedback.

### 4.3. System Constraints
- **Platform:** Designed to run on systems with minimal dependencies; specifics to be decided later.

## 5. UI/UX Design

### 5.1. Minimal Design
- **Simplicity:** The interface will be clean and uncluttered, showing only essential game information.
- **Text-Only Layout:** Rely solely on text output to keep the experience straightforward and focused.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Use clear, consistent fonts, spacing, and symbols to structure output effectively.

### 5.2. Immersive Experience

### 5.3. Smooth User Experience
- **Intuitive Commands:** Available actions and commands are clearly displayed and context-sensitive to the player’s current state.
- **Error Handling:** The system provides clear feedback for invalid inputs and guides the player back to the correct options.
- **Performance:** Quick response times ensure that the game feels smooth and responsive.
